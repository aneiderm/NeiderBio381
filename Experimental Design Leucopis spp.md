#Experimental Design: *Leucopis* spp.

In this experiment, we are looking at the development of *Leucopis* spp. and their ability to reduce Hemlock Woolly Adelgid population numbers.
Treatment 1 is a hemlock branch with no branch enclosure and no *Leucopis* spp.
Treatment 2 has a branch enclosure but no *Leucopis* spp.
Treatment 3 is a branch with an enclosure and 5M and 5F *Leucopis* spp.

| 1. YES-NO-NO |Contaminated study area |Enclosures affecting HWA|
| 2. YES-YES-NO | Contaminated study area | Leucopis not decreasing HWA |
| 3. YES-YES-YES | Contaminated study area | HWA decreasing regardless |
