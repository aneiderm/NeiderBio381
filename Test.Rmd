```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(ggmap) #automatically loads ggplot as well
library(rgdal) #automatically loads sp
library(foreign)


# Some example map fetching:
avl <- get_map(location="Asheville, North Carolina")
ggmap(avl)
# Different maptypes: "terrain","toner","watercolor" and lots of others (helpfile)
# Haven't had luck getting terrain to work
avl <- get_map(location="Asheville, North Carolina",maptype = "toner")
ggmap(avl)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
