[HW 2: HWA Biocontrol Decision tree](Biocontrol Merit Diagram.html)

This diagram outlines the decision process for choosing an appropriate predator for the hemlock woolly adelgid.  This decision tree informs the experimental design outlined below.


[HW 2: Experimental Design for 2018 *Leucopis* spp. project](Experimental Design Leucopis spp.html)

In this experiment, we are looking at the development of Leucopis spp. and their ability to reduce Hemlock Woolly Adelgid population numbers. 
Our hypothesis is that *Leucopis* spp. populations will be inversely correlated with that of HWA.
