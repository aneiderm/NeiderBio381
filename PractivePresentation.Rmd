{Fig 1 (Havill et al. 2014): Biological control efforts have merited attention due to their host specificity, ability to lower and target HWA during multiple parts of its lifecycle, scalability, long-term potential to establish, and minimal impact on hemlock mortality$^5$.}

##Study Objectives
- __Objective 1:__ Determine the relationship between temperature and the development and fecundity of *Leucopis* spp. on east coast HWA.

- __Objective 2:__ Analyze the effects of co-habitation of Laricobius nigrinus and Leucopis spp. for possible negative interactions. 

- __Objective 3:__ Assess the establishment, phenology, survival, and fecundity of the PNW Leucopis spp. in a full tree enclosure.
